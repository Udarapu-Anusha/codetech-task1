<br>Overview of the project:</br>
<br>PROJECT: Basic Calculator</br>
        <br>Purpose:</br> 
                 The project's purpose is to create a simple calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
<br>Components:</br>
<br>Main Function (calculator()):</br>
<br>This function serves as the core of the calculator program.</br>
<br>It first welcomes the user and displays available operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.#It then prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation.</br>
<br>Depending on the operation chosen, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation</br>
<br>It handles edge cases such as division by zero by providing an error message.</br>

<br>Input Handling:</br>
<br>Uses input() function to collect user inputs for numbers and operation choice.</br>
<br>Converts user inputs from strings to floating-point numbers for numerical operations.</br>
<br>Handles potential ValueError exceptions if non-numeric inputs are entered.</br>

<br>Operations:</br>
<br>Performs addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) based on the user's selection.</br>
<br>Outputs the result of the operation in a formatted string.</br>

<br>Error Handling:</br>
<br>Checks for division by zero before performing division.</br>
<br>Displays an error message if invalid inputs are detected (e.g., non-numeric values for numbers or incorrect operation choice).</br>

<br>Execution:</br>
<br>The program is executed as a standalone script (if __name__ == "__main__":).</br>
<br>It runs the calculator() function, which orchestrates user interaction, calculation, and result display.</br>

<br>User Experience:</br>
<br>Users are guided through a series of prompts to enter numbers and select an operation.</br>
<br>The program calculates the result based on the chosen operation and provides immediate feedback to the user.</br>

<br>Functionality:</br>
<br>Provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).</br>
<br>Handles typical user interactions and errors gracefully to ensure smooth operation.</br>

<br>Implementation:</br>
<br>Written in Python, making use of basic input/output operations (print() and input()).</br>
<br>Uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine the operation to perform based on user input.</br>
<br>Includes error handling to manage potential exceptions and ensure robust behavior.</br>

<br>Output:</br>

<br>Conclusion:</br>
                  <br>This project serves as a foundational example of creating a simple calculator in Python. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, error handling, and function-based organization. It provides a practical tool for performing basic calculations and serves as a starting point for more complex calculator applications or interactive Python projects.</br>
