Overview of the project:
PROJECT: Basic Calculator
        Purpose:The project's purpose is to create a simple calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
Components:
Main Function (calculator()):
This function serves as the core of the calculator program.
It first welcomes the user and displays available operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.#It then prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation.
Depending on the operation chosen, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation
It handles edge cases such as division by zero by providing an error message.

Input Handling:
Uses input() function to collect user inputs for numbers and operation choice.
Converts user inputs from strings to floating-point numbers for numerical operations.
Handles potential ValueError exceptions if non-numeric inputs are entered.

Operations:
Performs addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) based on the user's selection.
Outputs the result of the operation in a formatted string.

Error Handling:
Checks for division by zero before performing division.
Displays an error message if invalid inputs are detected (e.g., non-numeric values for numbers or incorrect operation choice).

Execution:
The program is executed as a standalone script (if __name__ == "__main__":).
It runs the calculator() function, which orchestrates user interaction, calculation, and result display.

User Experience:
Users are guided through a series of prompts to enter numbers and select an operation.
The program calculates the result based on the chosen operation and provides immediate feedback to the user.

Functionality:
Provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Handles typical user interactions and errors gracefully to ensure smooth operation.

Implementation:
Written in Python, making use of basic input/output operations (print() and input()).
Uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine the operation to perform based on user input.
Includes error handling to manage potential exceptions and ensure robust behavior.

Output:

Conclusion:
This project serves as a foundational example of creating a simple calculator in Python. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, error handling, and function-based organization. It provides a practical tool for performing basic calculations and serves as a starting point for more complex calculator applications or interactive Python projects.
